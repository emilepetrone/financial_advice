**📬 If you'd rather join a mailing list** https://financial.carrd.co/ for updates

**🛠️ Tools**

I am using Obsidian to write this. 

**💡Origin Story**

This project started after I posted the idea on Reddit.

After a huge outpouring of support, I'm writing this book/repo/project. It is a work in progress. Feel free to create issues or PRs if you find something you think is incorrect or needs fixing. 

Thanks for your support!
